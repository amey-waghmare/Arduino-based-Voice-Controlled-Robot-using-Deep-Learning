# Arduino-based-Voice-Controlled-Robot-using-Deep-Learning

* Created a voice command dataset and performed data augmentation using padding and additive white noise.
* Performed audio pre-processing and feature extraction using Mel Spectrogram and trained a Deep NN model.
* Implemented a differential drive robot using Arduino to implement decisions based on voice commands
